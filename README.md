Motivation and classical conditioning
**Summary**:
This project involves simulating classic conditioning paradigms like Extinction, Blocking, and Overshadow using the Rescorla-Wagner rule. Additionally, the Kalman filter is employed to introduce both known and unknown uncertainties, enhancing the model's ability to support a broader range of paradigms.
